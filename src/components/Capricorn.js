                  "Like a pansy, Capricorns seem to only get better with age! Known for being hardworking and tenacious, Capricorns enjoy showing off the fruits of their labor, similar to a newly sprung, showy pansy. Pansies are a popular bloom in the cooler months. The hardy plant can survive freezing conditions, unlike other plants that typically require sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Capricorns, just like their zodiac flower, are warriors, even in the toughest conditions."
